Copies all files from a given directory into another directory recursively,
and deletes the original files.

The use case of this is to be able to put files into your dropbox folder on one computer,
and then run this script automatically/periodically on another computer to get a local backup
of the files without your dropbox quota running out.

Note that putting files into the dropbox folder is still a manual task. In the future I might
write a script that can synchronize a folder automatically, only copying new files to the
dropbox-folder-to-sync.
